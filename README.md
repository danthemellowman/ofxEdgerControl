### ofxEdgerControl

This is an openFrameworks addon for interfacing with the [Edgertronic High Speed Camera](http://edgertronic.com/). It's based on code by Jesse Garrison, Dan Moore, and Gene Kogan.

The Edgertronic camera streams a high-speed capture to a local webserver, and the library allows you to download the captures and load them into ofVideoPlayer.  

See the [Edgertronic wiki](wiki.edgertronic.com/index.php/Getting_started_in_a_hurry) for how to get the camera set up.
